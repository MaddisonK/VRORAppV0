# VRORAppV0
This repo contains a Unity project prototype with the aim to create a surgery-specific VR environment to optimize the surgical field of view with external cameras during tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy procedures.


This GitHub repository contains the core source code files that are used in the Unity application. The entire Unity project exceeds the data storage limit so could not be uploaded.
